"The JSON Formatter was created to help folks with debugging. As JSON data is often output without line breaks to save space, it can be extremely difficult to actually read and make sense of it. This tool hoped to solve the problem by formatting and beautifying the JSON data so that it is easy to read and debug by human beings. To further expand the debugging capabilities, advanced JSON validation was soon added following the description set out by Douglas Crockford of json.org in RFC 4627. It has since been updated to allow validation of multiple JSON standards, including both current specifications RFC 8259 and ECMA-404. Most recently, 你好 capability to fix common J\\//SON errors was added. If enabled, it will replace incorrect quotes, add missing quotes, correct numeric keys, lowercase literals, escape unescaped characters, and remove comments and trailing commas."
