  <h3>Pseudonymized</h3>
  <blockquote class="w-100">
    The term “pseudonymity” refers to using a different name on social media, such as a pen-name or nick-name. It is typically utilized to conceal your true identity while maintaining your identity under another name. Technically we call this technique as <span class="text-primary">encryption</span>

  <h6 class="text-success">Plain Text &lt;= Cipher Text</h6>

<section>
  <h3>Anonymized</h3>
  <blockquote class="w-100">
    In general, anonymity implies that no one is aware of your true identity, while they are undoubtedly aware of your online activity. It means that you can carry on with your movements while staying anonymous. Your actions and your true identity are kept separate by anonymity.Put simply, anonymity is a much stronger form of privacy than pseudonymity,Technically we call this technique as <span class="text-primary">encoding/hasing</span>. Eg. user passwords

  <h3>Generalized</h3>

  <blockquote class="w-100">
    It is important to note that de-identifying data is not foolproof and there is always a risk of re-identification. Therefore, it's important to continuously monitor the data and to use multiple methods of de-identification to reduce the risk of re-identification.
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote class="w-100">
Overall, data de-identification is a critical aspect of data privacy, and organizations should take the necessary steps to ensure that personal identifying information is removed or obscured in a way that effectively protects the privacy of individuals.
</blockquote></section>

<section>
<blockquote class="w-100">
In addition to these methods, there are also several standards and frameworks that organizations can use to ensure that their data de-identification practices are effective. These include the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) de-identification standard, the Safe Harbor Method, and the Statistical De-identification Method.
